  "startParagraph": "I come from a liberal arts background where I developed a habit of learning difficult things quickly. In two years in Japan I went from completely overwhelmed to a confident teacher of hundreds of students and a fluent speaker of Japanese. After returning from Japan I discovered my true passion, programming. That passion drives me today to improve on what I know, learn from others, and one day build a great web app that changes people lives."
