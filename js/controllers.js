In two years in Japan I went from completely overwhelmed to a confident teacher of hundreds of students and a fluent speaker of Japanese. After returning from Japan I discovered my true passion, programming. That passion drives me today to improve on what I know, learn from others, and one day build a great web app that changes people lives."

At Lionbridge I was recognized as one of the best employees in an office of over 50 people. I know I can do the same at your company."
